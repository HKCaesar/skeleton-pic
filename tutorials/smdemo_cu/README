This program contains sample codes for illustrating how to set up
and run a simple parallel test code, using CUDA with both C and Fortran.
The test case is simple vector add function. These codes can be used as
templates for setting up more complex programs.

For CUDA, two executables can be created:
cgputest_cu, creates a C main program from a C library gpumain_cu.cu
fgputest_cu, creates a Fortran main program from a C library gpumain_cu.cu
The C library gpumain_cu.cu is compiled using the NVIDIA nvcc compiler.
The main program cgputest_cu.c is compiled using gcc.
The main program fgputest_cu.f90 is compiled using gfortran.

To compile and link each individual program, execute:

make program_name

where program_name is either:
fgputest_cu, cgputest_cu

To compile only the 2 CUDA programs, execute:

make cuda

To compile all the programs, execute:

make

The makefile is setup to use gcc, gfortran.  A version for Mac OS X is
also in the Makefile, but is commented out.

To execute most programs, type the name of the executabe:

./program_name
