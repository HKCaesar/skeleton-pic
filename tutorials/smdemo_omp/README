This program contains sample codes for illustrating how to set up and
run a simple parallel test code, usng OpenMP with both C and Fortran.
The test case is simple vector add function. These codes can be used as
templates for setting up more complex programs.

For OpenMP, two executables can be created:
comptest, creates a C main program from a C library ompmain.c
fomptest, creates a Fortran main program from a Fortran library ompmain.f
The C library ompmain.c is compiled using the gcc compiler.
The Fortran library ompmain.f is compiled using the gfortran compiler.

To compile and link each individual program, execute:

make program_name

where program_name is either:
comptest or fomptest

To compile both programs, execute:

make

The makefile is setup to use gcc, gfortran with Linux.  A version for
Mac OS X is also in the Makefile, but is commented out.

To execute either program, type the name of the executable:

./program_name
