This program contains sample codes for illustrating how to set up
and run a simple parallel test code, using Pthreads with both C and
Fortran.  The test case is simple vector add function. These codes can
be used as templates for setting up more complex programs.

For Pthreads, two executables can be created:
cpthtest, creates a C main program from a C library pthmain.c
fpthtest, creates a Fortran main program from a Fortran library pthmain.f
The C library pthmain.c is compiled using the gcc compiler.
The Fortran library pthmain.f is compiled using the gfortran compiler.
All of these libraries rely on a library called LnxMP.c, which provides
a simplified interface for the Posix pthreads library.  A description of
the library LnxMP.c is in the document LnxMP.txt.

To compile and link each individual program, execute:

make program_name

where program_name is either:
cpthtest or fpthtest

To compile both programs, execute:

make

or 

make pthreads

The makefile is setup to use gcc and gfortran with Linux.  A version for
Mac OS X is also in the Makefile, but is commented out.

To execute most programs, type the name of the executable:

./program_name
